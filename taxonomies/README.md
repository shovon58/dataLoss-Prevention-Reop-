# DLP Taxonomies 

A taxonomy (e.g., standardized vocabulary) allows to tag, classify and organise information among organisations.

The following taxonomies can be used in your documentation, unstructured data, and tools to share a common vocabulary among your DLP ecosystem to mitigate data exfiltration.

## Glossaries also known as security term definitions

A small set of infosec terms with standard definitions increase communication and support risk reduction among all stakeholders.

There is _some_ agreement between all the definitions for infosec terms although, it lack a general groupings (e.g., categories) necessary

 The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) is a standard for describing cyberattack patterns (MITRE, 2017) that fits into STIX. CAPEC has 508 terms to portray all possible attack patterns. STIX and CAPEC are examples of the intricate threat detail capable with CTI standards. These capabilities aid threat analysis, but a higher-level perspective supports strategic CTI products.

A taxonomy of IT threat terms can provide appropriate categories at various levels of granularity to aid threat analysis, risk assessments, and ultimately decision-making. Capturing and organizing unstructured threat information through CTI and incident response activities requires a standard set of threat terminology. Reports and metrics with a common set of terms can speed comprehension of the threats and incident response times. Business unit management and organizational leadership can more quickly understand the greatest threats to their organization after reviewing threat reports and metrics with standard terminology.

Information security operations provide analysts with a rich vocabulary of cyber threat terms and a structure for appropriately characterizing attacks. CTI and incident response operations describe and analyze an attack in great detail to support threat hunting, sharing, and governance of information security operations.

### Operational risk

The taxonomy of Operational risk can be organised into eight main categories: 
1. fraud
2. non-compliance with regulations
3. legal and liability losses
4. information security breaches
5. physical security breachess
6. inappropriate business practices
7. disaster recovery & business continuity
8. human resources
