# Datasets

 I have used [curated data resources](source.md) and several [data generators](#KnownDataGenerators) and to obtain _good enough_ American, Canadian, and European specific datasets.

Itâ€™s essential to support country specific localisation (l10n) as an integral part of your policies to reduce false positive and false negative. The flexibility provided by the internationalisation (i18n) to ensure that DLP policies can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

The datasets are identified with the country ISO code except for generic english document.
